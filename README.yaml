description: |-
  All data in Snowflake is stored in database tables, logically structured as collections of columns and rows. This
  component will create and control a Snowflake database, schema, and set of tables.

  ## Migrate `chanzuckerberg/snowflake` to `snowflakedb/snowflake` provider

  5/25/2022 the provider has been transferred from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) GitHub organization to snowflakedb org.
  To upgrade from CZI, please run the following command:

  ```shell
  terraform state replace-provider chanzuckerberg/snowflake snowflakedb/snowflake
  ```
